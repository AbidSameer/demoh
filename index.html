    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <h2>HTML - HyperText Markup Language</h2>
    <P>o	Hypertext: "Hypertext" refers to text displayed on a computer or other electronic device with references (hyperlinks) to 
    other text that the reader can immediately access. These hyperlinks can lead to different sections of the same document, 
    other documents, or entirely different websites. 
    The concept of hypertext is central to HTML, as it allows for the creation of interconnected documents and is fundamental to the 
    structure of the web..</P>
    <p>Markup Language: A set of rules that defines how the layout and content should be displayed in the browser. 
        It focuses on the presentation and structure of content.</p>
    <h1>1.	Tags and Elements</h1>
    <p>
        o	Tags are enclosed in angular brackets, e.g., <tag>.
            o	Elements consist of opening tags, content, and closing tags, 
            e.g., <<p>Content</p>.
            
    </p>
    <H1>2.	HTML tags are classified :</H1>
    <p>1.	Paired Tags or Container tags: Paired tags have both opening and closing tags, and they enclose content between them. 
        For example, p> and p> in the above example.
    2.	Self-Closing Tags or Empty tags or Void tags: Self-closing tags do not have a separate closing tag, and they are used to insert 
    elements that do not contain any content or do not require closing. 
    For example, img> for an image element, or br> for a line break.

           <p>Heading tags in HTML are used to define headings or titles for sections of content on a webpage. They range from <h1> to <h6>, with <h1> being the largest and most 
            important heading, and <h6> being the smallest and least important.</p>
           <p> •	>h1>: Largest heading<br>
            •	>h2>: Second largest heading<br>
            •	>h3>: Third largest heading<br>
            •	>h4>: Fouth largest heading<br>
            •	>h5>: fifth largest or second smallest heading<br>
            •	>h6>: Smallest heading</p>
                
        <h2>HTML tags are classified </h2>
        <h3>Preformatted Tag</h3>
           <p> •	>pre>: This tag is used for preformatted text. It preserves spaces, line breaks, and formatting as they are in the HTML code.
            
            Paragraph tags</p>
            <span>•	>p>: This tag is used to define a paragraph. It is a block-level element and automatically adds some space before and after the content.
            </p><span>
             <p>paragraph tag in HTML, denoted by <p>, is used to define paragraphs of text within an HTML document. 
                Paragraphs are blocks of text that are separated from other content by vertical spacing. When the browser renders HTML 
                containing paragraph tags, it automatically adds space above and below the text within the <p> tags, visually separating 
                it from surrounding content.</p>

            to insert elements that do not contain any content or do not require closing. For example, >img> for an image element, 
            or >br> for a line break.</p>
